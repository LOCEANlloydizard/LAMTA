# LAMTA

**LAMTA** (*LAgrangian Manifolds Tracking Algorithm*) is a Python code designed to compute numerical particle trajectories within ocean current 2‑D fields and to derive a range of Lagrangian diagnostics for detecting and tracking (sub)mesoscale ocean features.

## Manuscript and code

A dedicated manuscript is currently under development to describe the theoretical background, numerical methods, and applications of LAMTA in detail.

The source code is openly developed and maintained, with a focus on reproducible Lagrangian analyses in oceanography.

## Tutorials and examples

Tutorials and example workflows are provided as Jupyter notebooks and are
documented separately in the **LAMTA Examples** documentation.

**Go to the LAMTA Examples documentation:**  https://lamta-examples.readthedocs.io/

The examples include:

- Initialising and advecting particles in analytical flows  
- Working with `ParticleSet`
- Configuring advection schemes and parameters
- Handling periodic boundary conditions
- Applying LAMTA to realistic ocean current fields
