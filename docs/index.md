# LAMTA

**LAMTA** (*LAgrangian Manifolds Tracking Algorithm*) is a Python code designed to compute numerical particle trajectories within ocean current 2‑D fields and to derive a range of Lagrangian diagnostics for detecting and tracking (sub)mesoscale ocean features.

## Manuscript and code

A dedicated manuscript is currently under development to describe the theoretical background, numerical methods, and applications of LAMTA in detail.

The source code is openly developed and maintained, with a focus on reproducible Lagrangian analyses in oceanography.

## Tutorials and examples

Tutorials are provided as a series of Jupyter notebooks to help users get started with LAMTA and explore its main functionalities:

- **Analytical_examples.ipynb** – Initialising and advecting particles in theoretical (analytical) flows
- **ParticleSet.ipynb** – Initialising particles using the `ParticleSet` abstraction
- **Advection.ipynb** – Configuring advection modes and numerical parameters
- **Periodic_boundaries.ipynb** – Handling periodic boundary conditions
- **Ocean_examples.ipynb** – Applications to realistic ocean current fields

These notebooks are intended both as tutorials and as practical examples for adapting LAMTA to new datasets.
