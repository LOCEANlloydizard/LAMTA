## LAMTA

**LAMTA** (**LA**grangian **M**anifolds **T**racking **A**lgorithm) is a Python code
designed to compute numerical particle trajectories within ocean current 2-D
fields and to derive a range of Lagrangian diagnostics for detecting and tracking
(sub)mesoscale ocean features.

## Documentation and installation

Full documentation for **LAMTA**, including **installation instructions** and
general usage, is available [here](https://lamta.readthedocs.io/)

---

## Tutorials and examples

Hands-on tutorials and example workflows are provided as Jupyter notebooks and
are documented separately.

- The **LAMTA Examples documentation** is available [here](https://lamta-examples.readthedocs.io/)
- The corresponding **GitHub repository** can be found [here](https://github.com/OceanCruises/LAMTA_examples)

The examples cover topics such as:

- Initialising and advecting particles in analytical flows
- Working with `ParticleSet`
- Configuring advection schemes and parameters
- Handling periodic boundary conditions
- Applying LAMTA to realistic ocean current fields

## Manuscript

A dedicated manuscript is currently under development to describe the
theoretical background, numerical methods, and applications of **LAMTA** in
detail.
